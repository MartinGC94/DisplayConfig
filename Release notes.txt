5.2.0:
    Added new EdidData property to the output of Get-DisplayInfo which contains data read from the EDID stored in registry. The data includes: EdidVersion, Display serial number, display manufacture date.
    Added DisplayConfig parameter to Get-DisplayInfo this can be used to more easily view the pending display data stored in a DisplayConfig before applying it.
5.1.0:
    Fixed an issue where changing the resolution with Set-DisplayResolution to one with a different aspect ratio did not properly change the aspect ratio, resulting in a stretched or squished image.
        If the old behavior is still desired it can be applied with the DisplayConfig approach like so: Get-DisplayConfig | Set-DisplayResolution 1 800 600 | Use-DisplayConfig
    Added new "ChangeAspectRatio" parameter to Set-DisplayResolution. This parameter applies the aforementioned fix, but is only necessary when working with a DisplayConfig.
        If this parameter is used, no further changes can be made to the DisplayConfig so be sure to use it last before applying the config.
5.0.0:
    Made it so Set-DisplayPosition does not try to rearange cloned displays when specifying a specific position with the XPosition and YPosition parameters.
        If a cloned display group needs to be moved, all displays needs to be specified in a displayconfig like this: Get-DisplayConfig | Set-DisplayPosition -DisplayId 1 -XPosition 2560 | Set-DisplayPosition -DisplayId 2 -XPosition 2560 | Use-DisplayConfig
    Moved the DisplayConfig parameter definition for each command to the bottom so it shows up last in the tab completion.
4.0.0:
    Fix index out of bounds error when changing resolution, cloning a display or disabling a display on certain system configs.
    Update Disable-Display so it restores the previous desktop layout instead of adjusting the current one when run by itself.
        The old behavior is still used when a displayconfig is passed in, so if the old behavior is desired, one can run: Get-DisplayConfig | Disable-Display -DisplayId 1 | Use-DisplayConfig
    Removed the DontSave parameter for Disable-Display as it cannot be used with the new API call.
3.3.1:
    Fix regression where Get-DisplayConfig wouldn't write to the output stream.
3.3.0:
    Added an explicit error when the API returns no paths (because it's in a headless environment), replacing the previous invalid parameter error.
    Added recommended actions for when the API returns no paths and when the specified DisplayID was not found.
3.2.2:
    Fixed issue where very precise refresh rates could not be applied due to a conversion issue.
3.2.1:
    Fixed issue where very precise refresh rates could not be applied due to a conversion issue.
3.2:
    Updated the refresh rate and resolution argument completers to include the recommended refresh rate and resolution, as determined by Windows.
    Updated the resolution argument completer to not list height values that would be invalid for the already specified width value and vice versa.
    Made it so "Set-DisplayScale" with the "Recommended" switch explicitly set to false throws an error instead of unexpectedly setting the scaling to 100%
    Fixed issue where inactive displays would not show up in the list of available displays if the max amount of active displays on the GPU had already been reached.
3.1.0:
    Added new "DisplayIdToDisable" parameter to "Enable-Display". This can be used to disable displays while enabling others.
    Made "Enable-Display" more robust on certain system configs.
3.0.2:
    Fixed Set-DisplayResolution so it works with the recent virtual mode changes.
3.0.1:
    Published "Release" mode build rather than "Debug".
3.0:
    Made the module virtual mode aware which has the following effects:
        Raises the minimum OS version to Windows 10.
        Fixes displayId assignment when there are cloned displays across multiple display adapters.
        Makes it possible to clone across multiple display adapters.
    Simplified the parameter sets for "Set-DisplayPosition":
        Removed the Config specific parameter sets.
        Removed the "ApplyNow" parameter as it is no longer needed. If the DisplayConfig parameter is not specified, it will apply the changes immediately.
        The "Position" parameter set is now the default and "XPosition" and "YPosition" are no longer mandatory, allowing adjustment of one without the other.
    Fixed index out of bounds error when cloning a display while another display was disabled.
    Fixed positioning error when disabling or cloning displays with different resolutions.
    Added new switch parameter "AllowChanges" to Set-DisplayResolution. When this is set, Windows will make slight adjustments to the refresh rate or resolution if needed to apply the config.
    Added new switch parameter "AsClone" to "Enable-Display". When this is set, the specified displays are enabled as needed and put into one clone group.
        This allows Windows to determine the best clone source instead of manually specifying it with "Copy-DisplaySource" and it works with disabled displays.
    Updated the displayId completer list item text and tooltip to include the connection type.
    Updated "Use-DisplayConfig" so the "UpdateAdapterIds" parameter defaults to true for imported configs.
2.0:
    Made it so DisplayIds are grouped by display adapter (GPU) and then connection type. This makes the DisplayId assignments consistent on systems with multiple display adapters.
    Fixed an issue where "Use-DisplayConfig -UpdateAdapterIds" would throw an error if there were unused adapters in the displayconfig.
    Fixed an uncaught exception in Get-DisplayInfo when specifying an invalid DisplayId.
    Added views to format DISPLAYCONFIG_PATH_SOURCE_INFO and DISPLAYCONFIG_PATH_TARGET_INFO objects.
    Added recommended actions to the ErrorRecords for two common user errors for Set-DisplayRefreshRate and Use-DisplayConfig.
    Updated completion tooltip for displays without a friendlyname from "Unknown" to "Unknown Display".
1.1.1:
    Published "Release" mode build rather than "Debug".
1.1:
    Added new "Get-DisplayHDR" and "Set-DisplayHDR" commands to manage HDR settings.
    Fixed error handling in some commands where specifying an invalid DisplayId would cause a terminating error rather than a standard error.
1.0.6:
    Added new "UpdateAdapterIds" parameter to "Use-DisplayConfig". This parameter can be used to fix the error "The parameter is incorrect" when importing an exported display config.
1.0.5:
    Added an argumenter completer for the "SwapDisplays" parameter for "Set-DisplayPosition".
1.0.4:
    Added new "SwapDisplays" parameter to "Set-DisplayPosition". This parameter can be used to swap the desktop position of 2 different displays.
1.0.3:
    Added "Unknown" as a fallback to the display ID completer tooltip for displays where the friendlyname hasn't been set.
1.0.2:
    Fixed error where "Get-DisplayInfo" would sometimes throw an error, or find the wrong display.
    Fixed a problem with the DeviceId completer would sometimes throw an internal error, and not return any completion results.
    Fixed a problem where the tooltip in the DeviceID completer would sometimes show the wrong monitor name.
1.0.1:
    Fixed issue where a displayID did not always match the correct display.
1.0:
    Initial release.
